They say the best way to learn is to teach. I'm maintaining this blog to teach my future self, because I know I won't remember much of the stuff I write here.

The blog posts will be mostly about web development skills and knowledge; maybe sometimes I will share a few of my thoughts and feelings. Each post should be small and easy to digest.

Though I will be the main reader of this blog, I don't mind if you find something helpful here and want to share the joy with me.
