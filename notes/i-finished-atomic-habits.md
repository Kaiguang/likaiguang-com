I finished reading the book **Atomic Habits** by _James Clear_.

I'm a creature of habit, the things I do every day may seem to be from the decisions I made, but on a deeper level I think they are pretty much shaped by my surroundings including physical objects, people and animals.

The books talks about laws to form a habit:

- Make it obvious
- Make it attractive
- Make it easy
- Make it satisfying

It basically boils down to: I shape my environment, and in return my environment shapes me into the kind of person I want to become.

The book also has some tips and tricks on how to help readers forming habits, or getting rid of bad habits.
