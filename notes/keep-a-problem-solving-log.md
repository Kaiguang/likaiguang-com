Often times I found myself tackling a problem for quite a long time, thinking deep about finding a solution without typing anything down. And then an interruption came and all my thoughts were lost.

When starting a project or working on a feature, instead of jumping in and type the code, I can start with typing the notes to describe what I would like to do, and then break them down into smaller steps, to better translate into code.

The log can in any format, a note pad, a Notion page. I like to keep a separate git repo, small and local, with markdown files.

This can serve the purpose of recording how far I am into the problem, like a saving point in gaming. It will be easier for me to resume the work if anything interrupts me.

It also helps me with better evaluation of the solution, because the thinking process is logged and I can read about how I get to that step.

Let this be my cue to write more.
