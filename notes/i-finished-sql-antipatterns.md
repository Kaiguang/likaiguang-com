I finished reading the book **SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming** by _Bill Karwin_.

The book was very inspirational for someone who's new into the SQL programming world. It was from 2010 but surprisingly a lot of the knowledge is still relevant today.

It talked about a few antipatterns people made when designing a database with somewhat real examples. It's kind of related to the real world problems I face everyday, but on a shallower level. It's easy to understand for general readers with some basic SQL syntax knowledge, but sometimes in the real world the database system is far more complex than what's in the book, and often the developers need to evaluate the tradeoffs among all the patterns available.

As a reader, I got to know more patterns from the book, and I can pick which patterns I can adopt to solve my specific set of problems. I highly recommend new developers read this book at the introduction level.
