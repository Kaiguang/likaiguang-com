I found this fun hacker game website called [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), it can help me learn and practice my Linux skills.

<!--truncate-->

It has many different wargames that you can choose.

I started with the Bandit game. As of 2022-01-03, I have finished the game, which is for Linux beginners to get familiar with the Linux system and its basic commands.

The Bandit has over 30 levels, and each level has a puzzle that you need to solve to obtain the password to the next level.
